# Writing articles

The Scratch Channel is of course, a news site, so we are looking for new article writers.

We're trying to keep a relatively high standard of writing, so if you are applying we are unlikely to accept you if your writing isn't very advanced.

## How to apply

Join our discord server at <https://discord.gg/PHykGf3sKx>. Here, go to the #open-ticket channel and press open a ticket. In here, make sure to write an example article that would be worthy of being published on The Scratch Channel. The example you give should be high quality, we will decide whether to let you on based on how good it is.

We will not allow AI generated articles.
