# Setting up the development environment

Firstly, make sure you have all of the following:

- Node.js
- A device that can run a terminal (Such as Linux or Windows Command Prompt)
- Git
- A GitHub account

Second, create a fork of the repository then clone your fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/REPLACEWITHYOURUSERNAME/tsc-web-client.git
```

Third, install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This could take a bit.

Finally, you can now edit the code. Commit your changes then make a PR. The dev team will look into it and decide whether to merge it or not.
